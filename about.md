Not Enough Practice started when a couple recent graduates realized that after studying Security and Forensics in university that they were not prepared for the practical world. 

This blog is a place for them to practice their skills using exercises they find online and share their experiences with others looking to do the same. 

The hope is to eventually build a community where professionals and students can share their experience as we all practice together. Creating a judgement free zone where new people can join in and try something they may otherwise be scared to do in a large Capture the Flag or Forensic Rodeo.

If you like what we're doing and want to join our **very** new community or have any suggestions - please tweet us [GetPracticing](https://twitter.com/{{ site.twitter_username }}).
